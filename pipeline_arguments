#### PIPELINE ARGUMENTS FOR THE PALMER LAB HS RAT GENOTYPING PIPELINE ####

# place absolute paths for directories and files on the designated lines below
# do not delete or reorder any lines, or the pipeline will fail!

## UNIVERSAL ARGUMENTS - FOR NEWLY-SEQUENCED INDIVIDUAL FLOWCELLS AND FULL GENOTYPING ROUNDS ##

# replace line 9 below with your working directory (usually, the flow cell directory)
/projects/ps-palmer/hs_rats/round10_2
# replace line 11 below with the directory that holds all code for the pipeline
/projects/ps-palmer/hs_rats/round10_2/code_rn7
# replace line 13 below with the directory that holds various software input files
/projects/ps-palmer/hs_rats/round10_2/inputs
# replace line 15 below with the path to the reference genome
